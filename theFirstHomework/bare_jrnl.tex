\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed

%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{S}{o}, we have described the application of neural networks to supervised learning, in which we have labeled training examples. Now suppose we have only a set of unlabeled training examples$\left\{{{x^{(1)}},{x^{(2)}},{x^{(3)}},\dots} \right\}$,where$x \in {\Re ^n}$.An autoencoder neural network is an unsupervised learning algorithm that applies backpropagation, setting the target values to be equal to the inputs. I.e., it uses${y^{(i)}} \in {x^{(i)}}$.
Here is an autoencoder:

%the 2 
The autoencoder tries to learn a function $h_{W,b}(x)\approx x$. In other words, it is trying to learn an approximation to the identity function, so as to output ${x}$ that is similar to $x$. The identity function seems a particularly trivial function to be trying to learn; but by placing constraints on the network, such as by limiting the number of hidden units, we can discover interesting structure about the data. As a concrete example, suppose the inputs x are the pixel intensity values from a $10 \times 10$ image (100 pixels) so $n=100$, and there are $s^{2}=50$ hidden units in layer $L_2$. Note that we also have $y \in Re^{100}$. Since there are only 50 hidden units, the network is forced to learn a "compressed" representation of the input. I.e., given only the vector of hidden unit activations $a^{(2)} \in Re^{50}$, it must try to "reconstruct" the 100-pixel input $x$. If the input were completely random-say, each $x_i$ comes from an IID Gaussian independent of the other features-then this compression task would be very difficult. But if there is structure in the data, for example, if some of the input features are correlated, then this algorithm will be able to discover some of those correlations. In fact, this simple autoencoder often ends up learning a low-dimensional representation very similar to PCAs.
%3
Our argument above relied on the number of hidden units $s_2$ being small. But even when the number of hidden units is large (perhaps even greater than the number of input pixels), we can still discover interesting structure, by imposing other constraints on the network. In particular, if we impose a "sparsity" constraint on the hidden units, then the autoencoder will still discover interesting structure in the data, even if the number of hidden units is large
%4
Informally, we will think of a neuron as being "active" (or as "firing") if its output value is close to 1, or as being "inactive" if its output value is close to 0. We would like to constrain the neurons to be inactive most of the time. This discussion assumes a sigmoid activation function. If you are using a tanh activation function, then we think of a neuron as being inactive when it outputs values close to -1.
%5
Recall that $a^{(2)}_{j}$ denotes the activation of hidden unit $j$ in the autoencoder. However, this notation doesn't make explicit what was the input $x$ that led to that activation. Thus, we will write $a^{(2)}_{j}(x)$ to denote the activation of this hidden unit when the network is given a specific input $x$.
%6
Further, let

\[
\hat{\rho} _{j} = \frac{1}{m}  \sum \limits_{i = 1}^m {[a_j^{(2)} ({x^{(i)}})]}
\]

%7
be the average activation of hidden unit j (averaged over the training set). We would like to (approximately) enforce the constraint
\[
\hat{\rho} _{j} = \rho
\]
where $ \rho $ is a "sparsity parameter", typically a small value close to zero (say $ \rho $=0.05). In other words, we would like the average activation of each hidden neuron j to be close to 0.05 (say). To satisfy this constraint, the hidden unit's activations must mostly be near 0.
To achieve this, we will add an extra penalty term to our optimization objective that penalizes $\hat{\rho} _j $ deviating significantly from $ \rho$. Many choices of the penalty term will give reasonable results. We will choose the following:
\[
\sum \limits _{j = 1} ^{s _2}  %1
\rho \log { \frac {\rho} {\hat{\rho} _j}%frac
}%log
+
( 1- \rho ) \log \frac{ 1 - \rho}{ 1 -\hat{\rho}_j }
\]
Here, $s_2$ is the number of neurons in the hidden layer, and the index $j$ is summing over the hidden units in our network. If you are familiar with the concept of KL divergence, this penalty term is based on it, and can also be written
\[
\sum \limits _{j = 1} ^{s_2} 
KL
(
\rho \parallel hat{\rho}_j
) 
\]
where 
$
KL
(
\rho \parallel hat{\rho}_j
)
=
\rho \log { \frac {\rho} {\hat{\rho} _j}%frac
}%log
+
( 1- \rho ) \log \frac{ 1 - \rho}{ 1 -\hat{\rho}_j }
$
is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a Bernoulli random variable with mean $\rho$ and a Bernoulli random variable with mean $\hat{\rho} _j$. KL-divergence is a standard function for measuring how different two different distributions are. (If you've not seen KL-divergence before, don't worry about it; everything you need to know about it is contained in these notes.)
This penalty function has the property that $
KL
(
\rho \parallel hat{\rho}_j = 0
)$
if $\hat{\rho }_j = \rho $, and otherwise it increases monotonically as $\hat{\rho}_j$ diverges from $\rho $. For example, in the figure below, we have set $\rho $=0.2, and plotted $
KL
(
\rho \parallel hat{\rho}_j
)$
for a range of values of :$\hat{\rho}_j$
%the picture2 is here
We see that the KL-divergence reaches its minimum of 0 at
\[
\hat{\rho}_j = \rho
\]
, and blows up (it actually approaches $\infty$) as $\hat{\rho}_j$ approaches 0 or 1. Thus, minimizing this penalty term has the effect of causing $\rho _j $ to be close to $ \rho $.
Our overall cost function is now
\[
J_{sparse}(W,b) = J(W,b) +
\beta 
\sum \limits _{j = 1} ^{s_2}
KL
(
\rho \parallel hat{\rho}_j
)
\]
where $ J(W,b)$ is as defined previously, and $\beta$ controls the weight of the sparsity penalty term. The term $\hat{\rho} _j$ (implicitly) depends on $W,b$ also, because it is the average activation of hidden unit $j$, and the activation of a hidden unit depends on the parameters $W,b$.
To incorporate the KL-divergence term into your derivative calculation, there is a simple-to-implement trick involving only a small change to your code. Specifically, where previously for the second layer ($l=2$), during backpropagation you would have computed
\[
\delta^{(2)}_i = 
\left( \sum_{j=1}^{s_{2}} W^{(2)}_{ji} \delta^{(3)}_j \right) f'(z^{(2)}_i)
\]
now instead compute
\[
\delta^{(2)}_i =
  \left( \left( \sum_{j=1}^{s_{2}} W^{(2)}_{ji} \delta^{(3)}_j \right)
+ \beta \left( - \frac{\rho}{\hat\rho_i} + \frac{1-\rho}{1-\hat\rho_i} \right) \right) f'(z^{(2)}_i)
\]
One subtlety is that you'll need to know $\hat{\rho}_i$ to compute this term. Thus, you'll need to compute a forward pass on all the training examples first to compute the average activations on the training set, before computing backpropagation on any example. If your training set is small enough to fit comfortably in computer memory (this will be the case for the programming assignment), you can compute forward passes on all your examples and keep the resulting activations in memory and compute the $\hat{\rho}_i$s. Then you can use your precomputed activations to perform backpropagation on all your examples. If your data is too large to fit in memory, you may have to scan through your examples computing a forward pass on each to accumulate (sum up) the activations and compute $\hat{\rho}_i$ (discarding the result of each forward pass after you have taken its activations $a^{(2)}_i$ into account for computing $\hat{\rho}_i$). Then after having computed $\hat{\rho}_i$, you'd have to redo the forward pass for each example so that you can do backpropagation on that example. In this latter case, you would end up computing a forward pass twice on each example in your training set, making it computationally less efficient.
The full derivation showing that the algorithm above results in gradient descent is beyond the scope of these notes. But if you implement the autoencoder using backpropagation modified this way, you will be performing gradient descent exactly on the objective $J_{sparse}(W,b)$. Using the derivative checking method, you will be able to verify this for yourself as well.

\subsection{Visualizing a Trained Autoencoder}
Subsection text here.
Having trained a (sparse) autoencoder, we would now like to visualize the function learned by the algorithm, to try to understand what it has learned. Consider the case of training an autoencoder on $10\times10$ images, so that $n=100$. Each hidden unit i computes a function of the input:
\[
a^{(2)}_i = f\left(\sum_{j=1}^{100} W^{(1)}_{ij} x_j  + b^{(1)}_i \right)
\]
We will visualize the function computed by hidden unit $i$-which depends on the parameters $W^{(1)} _{ij}$(ignoring the bias term for now)-using a 2D image. In particular, we think of $a^{(2)} _i$ as some non-linear feature of the input $x$. We ask: What input image $x$ would cause $a^{(2)} _i$ to be maximally activated? (Less formally, what is the feature that hidden unit $i$ is looking for?) For this question to have a non-trivial answer, we must impose some constraints on $x$. If we suppose that the input is norm constrained by $||x||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i^2 \leq 1$, then one can show (try doing this yourself) that the input which maximally activates hidden unit i is given by setting pixel $x_j$ (for all 100 pixels, $j=1,…,100$) to
\[
x_j = \frac{W^{(1)}_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{100} (W^{(1)}_{ij})^2}}
\]
By displaying the image formed by these pixel intensity values, we can begin to understand what feature hidden unit $i$ is looking for.
If we have an autoencoder with 100 hidden units (say), then we our visualization will have 100 such images—one per hidden unit. By examining these 100 images, we can try to understand what the ensemble of hidden units is learning.
When we do this for a sparse autoencoder (trained with 100 hidden units on 10 $\times$ 10 pixel inputs{^1} we get the following result:
%the picture is here huise

Each square in the figure above shows the (norm bounded) input image $x$ that maximally actives one of 100 hidden units. We see that the different hidden units have learned to detect edges at different positions and orientations in the image.
These features are, not surprisingly, useful for such tasks as object recognition and other vision tasks. When applied to other input domains (such as audio), this algorithm also learns useful representations/features for those domains too.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
